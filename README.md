# Run tests against all Git versions

## RPMs:
You can add RPMs in the `/rpms` folder

## Building RPMs:
The RPMs were built using [git-build](https://github.com/akshaydewan/git-build) forked from [snap-ci](https://github.com/snap-ci/git-build). To build locally, some tweaks will be required in the Rakefile. You might want to run the build in a Docker container.
